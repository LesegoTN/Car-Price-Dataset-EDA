About the Project:

The purpose of this mini project is to perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the provided car_price_dataset (given as a csv file)in order to understand the correlation or relationship between selling priceand different car features such as vehicle age, milage, km driven, fuel type,transmission type, engine size, max power , number of seats etc.
EDA plays a crucial role in understanding the structure of the dataset, identifyingpatterns, detecting anomalies (such as outliers) and preparing the data for future modeling or analysis. In Data Science, EDA reveals insights in ourdata that guide us in feature selection, data cleaning and model building.

This report documents the EDA process carried out using Python with interpretations and conclusions drawn at each stage of analysis.
