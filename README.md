## About the Project:

The purpose of this mini project is to perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the provided car_price_dataset (given as a csv file)in order to understand the correlation or relationship between selling priceand different car features such as vehicle age, milage, km driven, fuel type,transmission type, engine size, max power , number of seats etc.
EDA plays a crucial role in understanding the structure of the dataset, identifyingpatterns, detecting anomalies (such as outliers) and preparing the data for future modeling or analysis. In Data Science, EDA reveals insights in ourdata that guide us in feature selection, data cleaning and model building.

This report documents the EDA process carried out using Python with interpretations and conclusions drawn at each stage of analysis.

## Problem Statement
Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the given dataset using Python libraries such as Numpy, Pandas, and Matplotlib/Seaborn. The goal is to uncover underlying patterns, relationships, and insights from the data. 
Additionally, document your process with Python comments explaining your code, and for each section provide detailed conclusions and observations.

Requirements:
Software requirements:
• Python 3.12.10
• Jupyter Notebook(or any other Integrated Development Environment
(IDE) such as VS Studio code)
Python libraries used: Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-
Learn
Dataset:
Car_price_dataset.csv provided as project scope

This project is for the purpose of Exlploratory Dat Analysis (EDA) only.

## Dataset Description
The dataset consists of 15411 rows and 14 columns. It included categorical attributes such as car name, car brand, car model, seller type, fuel type, and transmission type. 
Numerical variables consisted of milage, engine, vehicle age, km driven, number of seats, maximum power, and selling price.
No missing values were found in the data set.
Selling Price is our target variable (dependent variable) and the rest are independent variables (i.e. Features).
